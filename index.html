                                         <p>This is a multichannel digital EEG recording using the international 10-20 placement system. The resting record is poorly organized but symmetric. A dominant posterior rhythm is seen but is poorly sustained. When present, it consists of a 10 hertz, 20 to 50 microvolt alpha rhythm. This attenuates with eye opening. During drowsiness, there is mild attenuation and slowing of the background rhythm. Stage II sleep was not achieved. Hyperventilation was not performed. Photic stimulation did not significantly alter the background rhythm. Prominent muscle artifact and movement artifact as well as electrode artifact was noted during this recording. There was noted also a single sharp left temporoparietal discharge.</p>

                                        <p>We make no claims at this point to say if the patient does or does not have ___ headache. 
                                        They were screen carefully through ICHD.  We also took additional precautions to ensure they have migraine by having the patients fill out additional questionnaires. Physical examinations were not done. </p>

                                        <p>Refer to the paper to see accuracy, specificity and accuracy. </p>

                                        <p>Further validation studies may further improve the validity of our initial pilot findings, such studies can include 1) expanding the sample group of the study 2) independent studies done as the same way as ours. </p>

                                        <p>The sensitivity and specificity of our test is closely tied to the IHS criteria and our impression is that the IHS criteria is accurate in the following situations. Patient is truthful, no significant language barrier, IHS questions are applied with in depth dialogue with a highly skilled interviewer and answers to the questionnaire questions are not blindly accepted.  The interviewer is given an interview form with long check lists for each of the stages of migraine which can be used by the interviewer to gain further clarity when the IHS criteria are a little unclear. </p>

                                        <p>There are theoretical consideration when headaches are clinically very different from each other in our opinion it is quite unlikely that the electrical signatures/ electrical bio-markers will be the same as they are from migraine.</p>

                                        <p>We do not recommend that our test be used  as a soul basis for diagnosis we recommend that they be seen by a skilled in headache diagnosis and that they take into consideration the patient history, physical, credibility, diagnostic barriers and any other relevant neurological lab test on file when forming their diagnostic opinion.
